- Mobile-first workflow


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - W3Schools was very useful while I was creating the Javascript logic to the rating and submit buttons. It provided me with live examples that were useful to test things and experiment. It gave me a solid start!
- [indraAK's Solution](https://github.com/indraAK/Interactive-rating-component) - This solution also has helped me a lot while I was struggling with CSS animations and some Javascript problems I found along the way.
